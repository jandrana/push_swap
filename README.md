# Push_swap
This repository contains the push_swap project that I developed as a Student of 42 Malaga. 

## Introduction
The `push_swap` project is a fundamental algorithmic challenge where you have to sort data in the most effective way possible. You're given a stack of integers, two stacks to manipulate, and a limited set of actions. The objective is to write a C program called `push_swap` that calculates and displays the smallest set of actions necessary to sort the initial stack. Developed within the project's guidelines, my program efficiently sorts the provided input.

## Experience 
Being able to complete this project meant a big step forward in my learning path since I consider it to be much more difficult that any other projects that I have developed in C so far. I believe it is the project I learnt the most from and it is definitely the one I have enjoyed most so far.

Things to highlight as learnt with this project:
 - Development, optimization and implementation of sorting algorithms
 - Utilization and deeper comprehension of data structures (double linked lists)

 ## Usage

 ### Supported platforms
 - Linux
 - macOS

 ### Prerequisites
 Before using the push_swap program, you need:
 - **GCC:** The GNU Compiler Collection

 ### Example of usage
 ```bash
Compile the program:
 make all

- Set the numbers you want to order:
 ARG="9 3 2"

- Execute the program
 ./push_swap $ARG
 ```

**Output:**
```bash
ra
sa
```
